TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Arcane Malignancies
As changelings sense the awakening of the eerie powers they inherited from their hag progenitors, they are often mortified to discover terrifying and debilitating alterations to their physique. While the call seizes the changelings’ minds around the time their bodies begin maturing, the arcane malignancies that mar their features and extremities have nothing to do with puberty.<br/><br/> Not every changeling develops a malignancy, and when a changeling does develop a malignancy, it is often unrelated to whatever traits her hag mother has. These transformations are more akin to a magical allergy, manifesting in response to the well of arcane energy bubbling away in the changeling’s core.<br/><br/> A changeling character can take an arcane malignancy as a drawback (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign</i> 64) in order to select an additional trait at character creation. Randomly determine the arcane malignancy by rolling a d% and consulting the table below.<br/><br/><table class="inner"><tr><td><b>d%</b></td><td><b>Effect</b></td></tr> <tr><td>1–2</td><td>The smallest three toes on each of your feet have fused together. You take a –2 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Perform (dance) checks.</td></tr> <tr><td>3–4</td><td>Your incisors grow so long and sharp that you have difficulty eating. Eating takes twice as long. Consuming a potion or other magical foodstuff requires a full-round action.</td></tr> <tr><td>5–7</td><td>You have an extra digit on each hand, which hampers your fine motor skills. You take a –2 penalty on Craft, Disable Device, and Sleight of Hand checks.</td></tr> <tr><td>8–10</td><td>Your limbs and torso are covered with piscine scales that you must constantly moisten. If more than 1 day passes without you applying at least a gallon of water to them, you take 1d3 points of damage each hour until you do so.</td></tr> <tr><td>11–13</td><td>Your skin bears a sizable scarlet mark that flushes and lightens with your moods.

You were hardly a model citizen as a child or young adult. Your reasons for turning to a life of crime may be varied, but what matters is that you eventually fell in with a certain well-connected and notorious crime lord named Gaedren Lamm. His reputation as a snake and a treacherous scoundrel was known to you, but for reasons of your own, you chose not to turn him down when he offered you a chance to work for him. You may have assumed you were an exception, or that you’d be able to handle him, or perhaps even planned to betray him. As it worked out, though, Gaedren got the upper hand and took you down you first. You may have served time in jail, may have been beaten by his thugs and left for dead, or could simply have had your profits stolen out from under you. Whatever the cause, Gaedren wronged you, and you are eager for the chance to get revenge.<br/><br/> Choose one of the following benefits.<br/><br/> <b>Hungry for Revenge</b>: You’ve never forgiven Gaedren for his betrayal, and have vowed to make him pay for what he did. Whether that’s seeing him rot in jail or a shallow grave, you hope to taste vengeance someday. Whenever you deal damage with a melee weapon on a creature that is flat-footed, you gain a +1 trait bonus on the damage roll. <br/><br/><b>Reformed Criminal</b>: You’ve given up the life of crime, and managed to talk your way out of any repercussions such as jail time or fines. You’ve told yourself that you would rather leave your past behind, yet the concept of seeing Gaedren Lamm pay for his crimes still appeals to you. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks, and Diplomacy is a class skill for you.

 You are in some way tied to the mysterious alien monument known as Silver Mount in Numeria, but you have forgotten an important piece of your past.

Regardless, your unusual origins mark you as somehow different from others, and you know the gaps in your memory hold the key to your past. You start play with a unique compass that doesn’t point north and is riddled with indecipherable alien markings—the only object you have that you know to be tied to your home. In addition, your inscrutable mannerisms give you a +2 trait bonus on opposed Bluff checks. <i>Suggestion</i>: Consider being a member of the android race from Pathfinder <i>Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Bestiary</i>.

 Whenever you are affected by a polymorph spell or effect, your nanites adjust completely at a molecular level. For the duration of the polymorph effect, you are treated as only a humanoid for the purpose of effects that target creatures by type. For example, a ranger’s favored enemy bonus against constructs wouldn’t apply to you while you are polymorphed, but nor would spells such as <i>make whole</i>. This trait modifies part of the android’s constructed racial trait, but otherwise that trait is unchanged (a polymorphed android still can’t gain morale bonuses, is still immune to fear, and so on).

Priests of Razmiran often make subtle use of potions to hide the fact that they do not receive spells from their deity, and they have become quite adept at imbibing potions surreptitiously. You have mastered these techniques; whenever you consume a potion, you can attempt a Sleight of Hand check with a +2 trait bonus opposed by onlookers’ Perception checks to hide the fact that you are drinking a potion (as if you were using Sleight of Hand to hide an object). The observer’s success doesn’t prevent you from drinking the potion, just from doing so unnoticed. This does not hide any visible effects that the potion might have on you, only the physical act of drinking the potion.

 You have the air of a person with money, allowing you to buy and sell valuables that otherwise are too rich for the local community. Once per week, when looking for an item with a price greater than the local community’s base value (see page 461 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i>), make a DC 10 Diplomacy check; add 10 to the DC for each community size category between the current community and the community size with a base value sufficient for that item. Success means (with GM approval) you’re able to sell or purchase that item as if the local community were of sufficient size. Each additional attempt (successful or otherwise) in that community increases the DC by an additional +10. <br/><br/><i>Example</i>: If you’re trying to find a <i>+1 cloak of resistance</i> (1,000 gp), you’d normally need to be in a small town (base value 1,000 gp) or larger to be able to find that item with little trouble. If you’re currently in a hamlet, that’s two community sizes away from a small town, so the Diplomacy DC is 30. If you went to a village and asked there, the DC would only be 20 because it’s only one community size away from a small town.
